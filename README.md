- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hunter Faulkner @hrflkner

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Economics and Quantitative Finance.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying a Master of Quantitative Finance at the University of Technology Sydney in Sydney, Australia.
     Prior to this, I obtained a Bachelors degree in Economics (Minor in Japanese) from the University of Memphis in Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
     I am at an intermediate level in Japanese and am also starting to pick up Mandarin and Cantonese.
     Programming-wise, I am most experienced with Python, R, SQL, and VBA; and am currently learning C++. 
     The applications of each have mostly been toward financial/economic data analysis and vizualization, however 
     I've recently been exporing the idea of building a Twitch bot for varioius tasks and the idea of building games.
     
     Overall, I enjoy programming a great deal and will continue to learn and grow every day.
